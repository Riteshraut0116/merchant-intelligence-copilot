DEPLOYMENT FILES:
-----------------
✓ QUICKSTART_DEPLOYMENT.txt - Quick start guide
✓ DEPLOY_BACKEND_RENDER.txt - Detailed Render instructions
✓ DEPLOY_FRONTEND_NETLIFY.txt - Detailed Netlify instructions
✓ DEPLOYMENT_CHANGES.txt - This file

HOW IT WORKS:
-------------
Backend:
- Flask app (app.py) receives HTTP requests
- Converts them to Lambda event format
- Calls existing Lambda handlers
- Converts Lambda response back to Flask response
- Zero changes to business logic

Frontend:
- Vite builds static files to dist/
- Netlify serves static files
- API calls go to Render backend
- Environment variable controls API URL

DEPLOYMENT METHODS:
-------------------
Backend (Render):
1. Direct upload: Zip backend folder and upload
2. Git integration: Connect repo and auto-deploy
3. CLI: Use render CLI for deployment

Frontend (Netlify):
1. Drag & drop: Build locally, drag dist/ folder
2. Git integration: Connect repo and auto-deploy
3. CLI: Use netlify CLI for deployment

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES:
----------------------
Backend (Render):
- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID (required)
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY (required)
- AWS_REGION (default: ap-south-1)
- BEDROCK_MODEL_* (defaults provided)
- PORT (auto-set by Render)

Frontend (Netlify):
- VITE_API_BASE_URL (required, set to Render URL)

COST:
-----
- Render: Free tier available (with cold starts)
- Netlify: Free tier includes 100GB bandwidth
- AWS Bedrock: Pay per API call

NEXT STEPS:
-----------
1. Deploy backend to Render
2. Get backend URL
3. Update frontend .env with backend URL
4. Build and deploy frontend to Netlify
5. Test the application
