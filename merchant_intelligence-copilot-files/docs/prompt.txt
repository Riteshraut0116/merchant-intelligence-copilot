TITLE: Upgrade Merchant Intelligence Copilot UI to Hackathon-Ready Product (No Kiro Specs) + Add GitHub Top-Right Link + Update README

PROJECT CONTEXT:
Repo: merchant-intelligence-copilot
Frontend: React + Vite + Tailwind
Backend currently provides:
- GET /health
- POST /generate-insights with JSON { csv_text: string, language?: "en"|"hi"|"mr" }

GOAL:
Make the UI interactive, attractive, and judge-ready. Add a real CSV upload UI (drag/drop + browse), polished dashboard with KPIs and charts, a “Why?” explainability drawer, theme toggle, About page, footer, and GitHub link in the upper-right corner. Update README to match.

OBJECTIVES (IMPLEMENT ALL):

A) App Shell + Navigation
1) Build a global app layout with a modern header and navigation:
   - Pages/routes: Dashboard, Upload Data, Copilot Chat, Weekly Report, Settings, About
   - Use sidebar on desktop + compact top navigation on mobile.
2) Add branding in header:
   - App name: Merchant Intelligence Copilot
   - Team: Bharat Brain Wave
3) Add a global disclaimer banner visible on all pages:
   - “AI‑assisted insights to support smarter business decisions.”
4) Ensure mobile responsiveness, spacing, and modern UI polish.

B) GitHub Link (Upper Right) — REQUIRED
1) Add a GitHub icon button at the upper-right of the header.
2) Read the repo URL from VITE_GITHUB_URL (env variable).
3) Open link in new tab with rel="noreferrer noopener".
4) Tooltip on hover: “View source on GitHub”.
5) If VITE_GITHUB_URL is missing/empty, hide the icon (do not render a broken link).
6) Icon must respect dark/light theme with hover/focus states.

C) Theme Toggle (Light/Dark)
1) Add a light/dark toggle in header near GitHub icon.
2) Persist theme in localStorage.
3) Implement Tailwind dark mode (class strategy) so both themes look great.

D) Upload Data Page (Real CSV Upload + Preview + Validation)
1) Create Upload Data page with drag-and-drop area + browse button.
2) Validate:
   - file extension must be .csv
   - required columns: date, product_name, quantity_sold, price, revenue
3) Show:
   - file name + size
   - preview first 5 rows in a table
4) On “Analyze”:
   - read CSV in browser
   - call backend /generate-insights with { csv_text, language }
5) Save the latest insights + last uploaded filename to localStorage so refresh keeps demo.

E) Dashboard Upgrade (Judge-friendly)
1) KPI cards at top:
   - Products analyzed
   - Alerts count
   - Average confidence
   - Top reorder item (highest reorder quantity)
2) Product selector:
   - user selects a product to view details
3) Forecast chart:
   - use Recharts
   - plot 7-day forecast yhat
   - show confidence band (yhat_lower/yhat_upper) if present
4) Insights cards/table:
   - Confidence badge colors:
     - Green > 80
     - Yellow 60–80
     - Red < 60
   - Urgency badge (high/medium)
   - Alert chips (spike/drop/slow_moving) + severity if present
5) Add “Why?” explainability:
   - For each product, show a drawer/modal with:
     - reason summary based on anomalies + forecast
     - reorder calculation explanation (forecast sum + safety stock)
     - confidence explanation (why high/medium/low)
   - Must be simple and merchant-friendly, not technical jargon.

F) Copilot Chat Page (UI + Graceful Stub)
1) Build chat UI:
   - message list (user/assistant)
   - input box
   - language selector EN/HI/MR
   - show disclaimer and confidence score under assistant messages
2) If backend /chat is not available, show a clear non-breaking message:
   - “Chat backend not connected yet.”
   - Keep UI working without crashes.
   - Optionally use latest insights summary to simulate a response locally.

G) Weekly Report Page (UI + Local Fallback)
1) Weekly report layout:
   - Top 3 priorities
   - Expected impact
   - Risks/alerts
2) If backend report endpoint is not available, generate client-side from latest insights:
   - prioritize reorder + anomalies
3) Include disclaimer and confidence notes.

H) About Page + Footer (Credibility)
1) Add About page with:
   - MSME problem summary + what solution does
   - AI usage: forecasting + Bedrock reasoning (high-level)
   - Responsible AI: disclaimers + confidence scoring + limitations
   - Hackathon context
2) Add footer visible on all pages:
   - “© 2026 Bharat Brain Wave”
   - “Built for AI for Bharat Hackathon”
   - GitHub link (optional repeat) using VITE_GITHUB_URL
   - Do not use copyrighted images/assets.

I) Update Frontend .env.example
Add these variables:
- VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:3000
- VITE_GITHUB_URL=https://github.com/<username>/<repo>

J) Update README.md
Update README.md so it matches the new UI and run steps:
1) Features list: upload CSV, dashboard KPIs, forecast chart, alerts, Why drawer, theme toggle, GitHub link, About page, chat/report UI.
2) How to run locally (Windows PowerShell friendly):
   - Frontend: cd frontend; npm i; copy .env.example .env; npm run dev
   - Backend: run local backend on port 3000 (FastAPI) OR deployed URL; explain VITE_API_BASE_URL usage.
3) Environment variables:
   - VITE_API_BASE_URL
   - VITE_GITHUB_URL
4) Add a short “Security note” about npm audit dev-server tool vulnerabilities and why we avoided breaking upgrades.
5) Add a 3-minute demo walkthrough section.

CONSTRAINTS:
- Keep dependencies minimal (avoid breaking changes).
- Must work with npm run dev.
- Must not hardcode GitHub URL; it must come from VITE_GITHUB_URL.
- Must not crash if chat/report backend endpoints are missing.
- Mobile responsive and visually polished.

ACCEPTANCE CHECKLIST:
1) npm run dev works.
2) Header shows theme toggle + GitHub icon (only if env var set).
3) Upload page supports drag/drop, validation, preview, and calls /generate-insights.
4) Dashboard shows KPIs, chart, badges, and Why drawer.
5) About + footer exist and look professional.
6) README has correct run steps and env vars.

IMPLEMENT NOW:
Make the code changes across frontend and README, then run npm run dev and fix any errors.
Finally summarize changed files and how to verify end-to-end.
