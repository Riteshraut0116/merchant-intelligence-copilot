RENDER DEPLOYMENT TROUBLESHOOTING
==================================

FIXED: Prophet/Pandas Compilation Issues
-----------------------------------------
The app has been updated to remove heavy dependencies (Prophet, scipy) that caused
compilation failures on Render's free tier.

NEW LIGHTWEIGHT APPROACH:
- Removed Prophet (Facebook's forecasting library)
- Removed scipy (scientific computing)
- Using simple moving average with seasonality
- All forecasting now uses pure numpy/pandas

CURRENT DEPENDENCIES:
- flask (web framework)
- pandas (data processing)
- numpy (numerical computing)
- boto3 (AWS SDK)
- gunicorn (production server)

These install quickly with pre-built wheels - no compilation needed!
