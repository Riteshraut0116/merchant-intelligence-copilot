NETLIFY DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS FOR FRONTEND
=============================================

1. Create a Netlify account at https://netlify.com

2. Update .env file:
   - Copy .env.example to .env
   - Set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your Render backend URL
   - Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://merchant-copilot-api.onrender.com

3. Build the project locally (optional test):
   npm install
   npm run build
   (This creates a dist/ folder)

4. Deploy to Netlify:

   METHOD A - Drag and Drop (Easiest):
   - Run: npm run build
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag the dist/ folder to the upload area
   - Done! Your site is live

   METHOD B - Netlify CLI:
   - Install: npm install -g netlify-cli
   - Run: netlify deploy --prod
   - Follow prompts and select dist/ as publish directory

   METHOD C - Git Integration:
   - Push code to GitHub/GitLab/Bitbucket
   - Click "New site from Git" in Netlify
   - Connect repository
   - Build settings (auto-detected from netlify.toml):
     * Build command: npm run build
     * Publish directory: dist
   - Add environment variable:
     * VITE_API_BASE_URL: your_render_backend_url
   - Click "Deploy site"

5. Configure Environment Variables (Netlify dashboard):
   - Go to Site settings > Environment variables
   - Add: VITE_API_BASE_URL = https://your-render-app.onrender.com

6. Your site will be live at: https://random-name.netlify.app
   - You can customize the domain in Site settings

7. Enable automatic deploys (if using Git):
   - Any push to main branch will trigger rebuild

Files included for deployment:
- netlify.toml (Netlify configuration)
- package.json (dependencies and build scripts)

IMPORTANT:
- Always set VITE_API_BASE_URL before building
