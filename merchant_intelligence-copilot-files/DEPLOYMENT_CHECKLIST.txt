DEPLOYMENT CHECKLIST
====================

Use this checklist to ensure successful deployment.

PRE-DEPLOYMENT:
---------------
[ ] AWS account with Bedrock access enabled
[ ] AWS Access Key ID and Secret Access Key ready
[ ] Render account created (https://render.com)
[ ] Netlify account created (https://netlify.com)
[ ] Git repository (optional, for auto-deploy)

BACKEND DEPLOYMENT (RENDER):
-----------------------------
[ ] Navigate to backend/ folder
[ ] Verify files exist:
    [ ] app.py
    [ ] requirements.txt
    [ ] Procfile
    [ ] runtime.txt
    [ ] render.yaml
    [ ] src/ folder with all handlers

[ ] Create new Web Service on Render
[ ] Configure build settings:
    [ ] Build Command: pip install -r requirements.txt
    [ ] Start Command: gunicorn app:app
    [ ] Python version: 3.12

[ ] Add environment variables in Render:
    [ ] AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
    [ ] AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    [ ] AWS_REGION (ap-south-1)
    [ ] BEDROCK_MODEL_PRIMARY (optional)
    [ ] BEDROCK_MODEL_FAST (optional)
    [ ] BEDROCK_MODEL_BASELINE (optional)

[ ] Deploy and wait for completion
[ ] Test health endpoint: https://your-app.onrender.com/health
[ ] Copy backend URL for frontend configuration

FRONTEND DEPLOYMENT (NETLIFY):
-------------------------------
[ ] Navigate to frontend/ folder
[ ] Update .env file:
    [ ] Set VITE_API_BASE_URL to your Render URL
    [ ] Example: VITE_API_BASE_URL=https://your-app.onrender.com

[ ] Install dependencies:
    [ ] Run: npm install

[ ] Build the project:
    [ ] Run: npm run build
    [ ] Verify dist/ folder is created

[ ] Deploy to Netlify (choose one method):
    METHOD 1 - Drag & Drop:
    [ ] Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
    [ ] Drag dist/ folder to upload area
    
    METHOD 2 - CLI:
    [ ] Install: npm install -g netlify-cli
    [ ] Run: netlify deploy --prod
    [ ] Select dist/ as publish directory
    
    METHOD 3 - Git:
    [ ] Push code to Git repository
    [ ] Connect repo in Netlify dashboard
    [ ] Add VITE_API_BASE_URL environment variable
    [ ] Deploy

[ ] Verify deployment successful
[ ] Test frontend: https://your-site.netlify.app

POST-DEPLOYMENT TESTING:
------------------------
[ ] Backend health check works
[ ] Frontend loads without errors
[ ] Can upload CSV data
[ ] Generate insights works
[ ] Chat functionality works
[ ] Weekly report generates
[ ] All API calls succeed

TROUBLESHOOTING:
----------------
Backend issues:
- Check Render logs for errors
- Verify AWS credentials are correct
- Ensure Bedrock is enabled in your AWS region
- Check environment variables are set

Frontend issues:
- Verify VITE_API_BASE_URL is correct
- Check browser console for errors
- Ensure backend is running and accessible
- Rebuild if environment variables changed

CORS issues:
- Backend already configured for CORS
- If using custom domain, update CORS settings in app.py

Performance:
- Render free tier has cold starts (first request slow)
- Consider upgrading to paid tier for production
- Netlify CDN provides fast static file delivery

SECURITY:
---------
[ ] Never commit .env files to Git
[ ] Use Render environment variables for secrets
[ ] Rotate AWS keys regularly
[ ] Enable HTTPS (automatic on Render/Netlify)
[ ] Review CORS settings for production

OPTIONAL ENHANCEMENTS:
----------------------
[ ] Set up custom domain on Netlify
[ ] Configure custom domain on Render
[ ] Enable automatic deployments from Git
[ ] Set up monitoring and alerts
[ ] Configure backup strategy
[ ] Add rate limiting to API

MAINTENANCE:
------------
[ ] Monitor Render logs regularly
[ ] Check AWS Bedrock usage and costs
[ ] Update dependencies periodically
[ ] Review and rotate credentials
[ ] Monitor application performance

ROLLBACK PLAN:
--------------
If deployment fails:
1. Check logs in Render/Netlify dashboard
2. Verify all environment variables
3. Test backend independently
4. Rebuild frontend with correct API URL
5. Contact support if needed

SUPPORT RESOURCES:
------------------
- Render docs: https://render.com/docs
- Netlify docs: https://docs.netlify.com
- AWS Bedrock: https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock
- Project docs: See DEPLOY_*.txt files

DEPLOYMENT COMPLETE!
--------------------
Once all items are checked, your application is live and ready to use.

Backend URL: https://your-app.onrender.com
Frontend URL: https://your-site.netlify.app

Share the frontend URL with users to access the application.
